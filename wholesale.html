        <h2 class="text-center">WHY BUY FROM US?</h2>

        <p class="text-center mx-md mb-md">Grain fed cattle account for over 50% of the cattle slaughtered in Australia
            each year. Grain fed cattle are often raised in conditions akin to a battery farmed chicken. Their movement
            is limited, their diet is simplistic - low in both fats and protein - and their quality of life is greatly
            diminished.</p>

        <p class="text-center mx-md mb-md">Not only is this bad for the animal, it is bad for the consumer. Muscle from
            a primarily grain
            fed animal often lacks the omega-3s and essential minerals and vitamins that you would find in a grass fed
            equivalent.</p>

        <p class="text-center mx-md mb-md">If you want the best for your customers, you should buy grass fed, paddock
            raised meat.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center mt-xl">WHAT DOES A FEEDLOT LOOK LIKE?</h2>
        <p class="text-center mx-md mb-md">A feedlot is just a giant patch of dirt where cattle are raised in unhealthy,
            unnatural
            conditions, usually requiring high doses of hormones, antibiotics and antiparasitics to produce beef. Cattle
            are born elsewhere on many different farms and moved into a single location. This spreads diseases and
            parasites as well as decreasing animal welfare and consequentially the quality of the beef.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center mt-xl">WHAT DOES A HABBIES FEEDLOT LOOK LIKE?</h2>
        <p class="text-center mx-md mb-md">A Habbies Howe feedlot doesn't exist. Instead we grow and fatten all of our
            cattle on a farm, in a paddock, that is stacked with grass. Cattle are never moved in from another farm.
            Every animal has spent its entire life at Habbies Howe. This allows us to have 100% traceability and highly
            refined genetics.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center mt-xl">WHERE IS HABBIES HOWE?</h2>
        <p class="text-center mx-md mb-md">Located in the North East Victoria, Habbies Howe is perfectly positioned to
            grow and sell beef. The climate is stable and rainfall is predictable. Additionally, the facilities required
            to process the animal are located near both the farm and the end customer. Cattle in Australia travel (on
            average) 1000 - 2500 kilometers to be processed. Compare that to the map below where cattle are kept within
            a 50km radius for their entire lifespan. One more reason to buy beef
            from us.</p>
